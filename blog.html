      <p>My private diary had recently become a thing for bigger, huge updates due to my inconsistency at updating it. I intend to just write short little things here. Or maybe longer little things. These entries couldn't possibly be longer than the ones in my personal diary though. I'm not sure how frequently I'll update this though, since I'm so bad at updating my other journal. While I imagine coding in my entries would probably be more effort, I hope I can use these for dumb, menial updates from time to time.

<p>It's been so long since I've coded this page, I forgot how to do it.<br>If this page breaks then. It's all over. If I'm being honest with you I don't really know how to fix this page if it broke. I don't know how to fix this website if it broke.</p>
<p>I know it's only been like, three months? Since this website launched and the last entry, but the truth is I spent the entire summer working on this site, and the blog page was one I made earlier cause I was like "I want a blog!!!! (<-- guy who hasn't expressed shitty opinions online in a while)" so I coded this page as soon as I could, but now I've forgotten what I've done with this page.<br>I just hope this page doesn't break haha.</p>
<p>That being said, what is the point of this page??? I said that the blog page is for small thoughts, but I also have a thoughts page? I usually like to segment my thoughts into categories of big thoughts and small thoughts, so I don't know what the point of this page is anymore. Maybe I'll write about some stuff without really elaborating. I guess I will start talking about stuff and stop once I get tired.</p>
<p>Recently, I moved houses (will not elaborate) and I've been watching some shows (will not elaborate), and since it's my birthday month, I've been working on a project for myself (will not elaborate)</p>
<p>Well, I'll elaborate about the video stuff actually. I feel like I do nothing but talk about video stuff, but I never actually make the videos I do public, so it just looks like I'm talking about something that doesn't exist. (Not to mention, I'm very slow when it comes to video stuff‚Ä¶)<br>I swear I will not hide when I post this video‚Ä¶ I think as always, the art is only okay. Usually I don't share these things cause I don't like the art on it, but when I think really hard about it, I'm the only one out here who's gonna make these videos with my OCs specifically in them. And some people don't have the time or motivation to work on this kinda stuff too üëç So like in a way, I'm actually pretty okay?? Since there are people who wouldn't even bother to do this sorta stuff????? (insane person coping, this is not how it works)</p>
<p>Anyways, I have a lot of things I wanna work on, but I'm just not skilled enough to pull it off without it taking a long time. A lot of the things I like to do have a lot of drawing involved in it lol. For now I'm just gonna keep brute forcing shit until I get it done.</p>
<p>That's it for now though, I think?? It probably reads a bit incoherent, but just writing stuff outta my ass wasn't too bad, and it took a short time (usually when I write for my journal it takes like two days) so maybe I will actually post more??</p>

  <div class="tabs__content">
  <div id="blogbox">
<h1 text align="center">LAUNCH!!</h1>
<p>This is the official(? I might pull back lol) launch of my public website! I have been working on this website slowly for a couple of months now. It doesn't look that way cause this website's so simple. But yea. I'm just slow and lazy but also extremely particular about certain things.</p>
<p>I don't know what pushed me to make a website, but a few months ago I deleted my twitter and since then I haven't been super active on any social media. I could honestly live without it, but also, I do like to share things from time to time. Or at least, get the satisfaction of posting something. To be honest I don't care if people see it or not. I thought it would be easier to share things if I had an entire site just dedicated to me doing so and that way no one would accidentally stumble onto me? You would deliberately have to type this URL to find me. So basically, you deliberately came here to read my bad opinions. You can only be mad at yourself.
<br>I think with having a website I'm just a bit harder to find and I prefer it that way.</p>
<p>I'm hoping I can post stuff here that I'm alright with posting? I don't know, I'm not too proud of most things I post so I wonder if this site will even go anywhere‚Ä¶ For the moment though, I just wanted to get this site up and running since it's been in the back of my mind for months. It's ready now though.</p>
<p>There's a lot of things I gotta fix up I'm sure but for now I'm fine with this site. To be honest, I got kinda tired of the theme already since I have been staring at it for a few months, but I can't restart that's too much effort.</p>
<p>I wanna log at least some stuff before the launch of this site on here too just so I have something, but it might be a while until I actually get to it. I don't think I do a lot of things, but it's still kinda a pain to look at everything I've done and decided if I want to post it or not.</p>
<p>But yeaaa that's all I have to say for now. I still gotta work on other aspects of this site so I will stop here.</p>
