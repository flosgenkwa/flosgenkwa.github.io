      <p>My private diary had recently become a thing for bigger, huge updates due to my inconsistency at updating it. I intend to just write short little things here. Or maybe longer little things. These entries couldn't possibly be longer than the ones in my personal diary though. I'm not sure how frequently I'll update this though, since I'm so bad at updating my other journal. While I imagine coding in my entries would probably be more effort, I hope I can use these for dumb, menial updates from time to time.

<h1 text align="center">my new years post on jan. 31</h1>
<p>Hi welcome to my VERY END of January new years post. It's 11pm my here, so while I'm very late I'm still in January.</p>
<p>Jan. 31st update! Happy new year to anyone reading!<br>Imma keep it short because I think I usually end up rambling a lot in these. Which is not really the point I wanted shorter entries on this site.</p>
<p>February feels like a really busy month for me! I have my planner filled out with a lot of things I want or have to do, although I'm pretty sure it's only because I'm super slow and bad at time management.</p>
<p>About the log, I'm still working on it basically everything is done but there's just oooone thing I want to draw before I post the log. Which is frustrating to me, but I'm sure if I keep at it it'll be done soon.<br>Also about Splatfest!! I'm super behind, I haven't even posted the pokemon Splatfest from a while ago haha. It is not high on my list of things I <i>need</i> to do right this moment, but I better do it soon or else I'll fall very behind. I don't really like writing, but I just thought writing dialogue for tricolor would be so cute? It makes everything a bit slower though. I have to sit down and really focus. I can't have any music on either or else I'll get distracted. I do want to work on it however so once I finish everything else of higher priority to me I'll do my best.</p>
<p>I hardly ever update this site and yet it feels like I do so many things. I guess I do a lot of things, but don't find them all that postworthy I guess? I think myself from the future would get mad at me now for not posting absolutely everything I've done. Like, at least post it somewhere privately if you're not gonna post it on your website or something like that. </p>
<p>My new years resolution is to have more self discipline, fix my sleep schedule, and to draw more Florence this year. God bless.</p>
<p>Also, I recently bought some clay and also some punch needle stuff and I really wanna get my hands on that, but I need to finish everything else first u_u<br>Hopefully, I'll post something about those two soon! Or maybe not.</p>

<h1 text align="center">I think I'm gonna remove the video section temporarily -_-</h1>
<p>Ya basically what the title says. I dunno I was working on a video and I have all the assets ready but like… I'm really tired. I probably won't work MVs for a while, I think I'm having fun just drawing for now.</p>
<p>I used to make the videos because I was never really satisfied with my art and it always looked better when it was moving and it was just multiple images on screen that only appeared for maybe 3-10 seconds.<br>I started making videos last year in 2021. I think I finished my first one in January, and I thought it was really fun and I was satisfied with the outcome. I kept making them and then I realized that my art was noticeably getting better? And I was getting faster too. Like I was finishing more drawings and actually coloring them and stuff, but when I colored them they looked kinda alright?<br>My standards for my art probably grew, but it probably grew to be bigger than what I can actually accomplish haha TT. (Not to mention I don't think full pieces are comparable to video assets so it's really an unfair comparison but my mind still judges) Recently I've grown to be more and more insecure about the art that shows up on these videos, and I wanna make something really good y'know. I think I only finished three MVs this year because I would start one, not be satisfied with it, and scrap it. WHICH LOGICALLY, SHOULD NOT MAKE SENSE because the assets I draw now look a lil better than the ones in the past. Oh well. I have issues and such.</p>
<p>For now I would just like to work on drawing I guess. Since I'm actually enjoying it haha</p>
<p>Having the video section on the website is making me feel really pressured to make an MV. I really like making MVs, but somehow I've become unhappier with my art in the MVs so yea I'm taking it down for the moment.</p>
<p>Don't take it as me being discouraged though. Well, I am. That was the Point of the post BUT LIKE I'M NOT LIKE SUPER BUMMED OUT ABOUT IT ITS MORE LIKE AW MAN THIS IS HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW AND IM FINE WITH THAT and its a little sad that I feel this way about something I really like BUT IM GONNA COME BACK ONCE I FEEL BETTER I LOVE MOVING IMAGES IN AFTER EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>I probably won't be making long MVs n stuff like I did last year but I'll probably just make bits and parts of MVs that I like. Like an animation meme but it's not catchy because it'll just be a random part of a song that I've awkwardly cut off.</p>
<p>I still really like making MVs and watching them. I'm always thinking about them lol. I have so many MV ideas in my mind but I feel like I would just get frustrated and give up again which I don't wanna do because I like the ideas In My Head……..</p>
<p>Basically, no videos for a while :,D</p>
<p>This entry was just to relieve my head cause I was a bit stressed about it. But ya basically IM IN MOTION GRAPHICS JAIL RIGHT NOW, BUT ILL COME BACK AND ILL BE LIKE AT LEAST SATISFACTORY!!!</p>
<p><br>OH YEA I FORGOT. I wanna post my first log here soon I'm very nervous but no one reads this website other than me. I specifically put this website on a host where you would have to deliberately search for me there is no possible way for anyone to "stumble" upon this website unless they were looking for me specifically so I don't know why I am afraid. Love and peace <3</p>

  <div class="tabs__content">
  <div id="blogbox">
<h1 text align="center">wow</h1>
<p>It's been so long since I've coded this page, I forgot how to do it.<br>If this page breaks then. It's all over. If I'm being honest with you I don't really know how to fix this page if it broke. I don't know how to fix this website if it broke.</p>
<p>I know it's only been like, three months? Since this website launched and the last entry, but the truth is I spent the entire summer working on this site, and the blog page was one I made earlier cause I was like "I want a blog!!!! (<-- guy who hasn't expressed shitty opinions online in a while)" so I coded this page as soon as I could, but now I've forgotten what I've done with this page.<br>I just hope this page doesn't break haha.</p>
<p>That being said, what is the point of this page??? I said that the blog page is for small thoughts, but I also have a thoughts page? I usually like to segment my thoughts into categories of big thoughts and small thoughts, so I don't know what the point of this page is anymore. Maybe I'll write about some stuff without really elaborating. I guess I will start talking about stuff and stop once I get tired.</p>
<p>Recently, I moved houses (will not elaborate) and I've been watching some shows (will not elaborate), and since it's my birthday month, I've been working on a project for myself (will not elaborate)</p>
<p>Well, I'll elaborate about the video stuff actually. I feel like I do nothing but talk about video stuff, but I never actually make the videos I do public, so it just looks like I'm talking about something that doesn't exist. (Not to mention, I'm very slow when it comes to video stuff…)<br>I swear I will not hide when I post this video… I think as always, the art is only okay. Usually I don't share these things cause I don't like the art on it, but when I think really hard about it, I'm the only one out here who's gonna make these videos with my OCs specifically in them. And some people don't have the time or motivation to work on this kinda stuff too 👍 So like in a way, I'm actually pretty okay?? Since there are people who wouldn't even bother to do this sorta stuff????? (insane person coping, this is not how it works)</p>
<p>Anyways, I have a lot of things I wanna work on, but I'm just not skilled enough to pull it off without it taking a long time. For now I'm just gonna keep brute forcing shit until I get it done.</p>
<p>That's it for now though, I think?? It probably reads a bit incoherent, but just writing stuff outta my ass wasn't too bad, and it took a short time (usually when I write for my journal it takes like two days) so maybe I will actually post more??</p>

  <div class="tabs__content">
  <div id="blogbox">
<h1 text align="center">LAUNCH!!</h1>
<p>This is the official(? I might pull back lol) launch of my public website! I have been working on this website slowly for a couple of months now. It doesn't look that way cause this website's so simple. But yea. I'm just slow and lazy but also extremely particular about certain things.</p>
<p>I don't know what pushed me to make a website, but a few months ago I deleted my twitter and since then I haven't been super active on any social media. I could honestly live without it, but also, I do like to share things from time to time. Or at least, get the satisfaction of posting something. To be honest I don't care if people see it or not. I thought it would be easier to share things if I had an entire site just dedicated to me doing so and that way no one would accidentally stumble onto me? You would deliberately have to type this URL to find me. So basically, you deliberately came here to read my bad opinions. You can only be mad at yourself.
<br>I think with having a website I'm just a bit harder to find and I prefer it that way.</p>
<p>I'm hoping I can post stuff here that I'm alright with posting? I don't know, I'm not too proud of most things I post so I wonder if this site will even go anywhere… For the moment though, I just wanted to get this site up and running since it's been in the back of my mind for months. It's ready now though.</p>
<p>There's a lot of things I gotta fix up I'm sure but for now I'm fine with this site. To be honest, I got kinda tired of the theme already since I have been staring at it for a few months, but I can't restart that's too much effort.</p>
<p>I wanna log at least some stuff before the launch of this site on here too just so I have something, but it might be a while until I actually get to it. I don't think I do a lot of things, but it's still kinda a pain to look at everything I've done and decided if I want to post it or not.</p>
<p>But yeaaa that's all I have to say for now. I still gotta work on other aspects of this site so I will stop here.</p>
