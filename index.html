		<p>Welcome to my  website! I'm Flos. This is a personal website, meant for me to log anything that I've worked on or have been up to. I am often working on art, sewing/embroidery, and motion graphic projects. I will probably talk about stuff like video games and mundane shit. If that sounds great then click on any link to enter. If it doesn't sound great you can leave now.</p>
